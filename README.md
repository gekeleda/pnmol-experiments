# :runner: Run Experiments

## :gear: 1. Install
In the root-directory, execute
```
pip install -e .
```

## :rocket: 2. Run and plot experiments
:warning: It is easiest if you run everything from the root directory. I.e., instead of navigating to the `experiments` directory, run

```
python3 experiments/figureX.py
```

where you just replace `X` by one of {1, 2, 3, 4}.
